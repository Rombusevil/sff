# Super Fast Framework - for Pico8

__SFF__ is a collection of lua objects, functions and a CLI app that allows for rapid development of games using Pico-8.
It allows for and provides the following features:  
- Divide your code into multiple .lua files.
- Divide your game into "States".
- Entities with animations, bounding boxes and flickering.
- Text object with support for centering, bold, shadow and blinking.
- Timers for schedulling and repeating code.
- A CLI app that generates boilerplate code and snippets.

Check the [manual](https://github.com/Rombusevil/sff/blob/master/docs/manual.md)  for information on how to use.  
More documentation will be added if people start using it.  
To run the _CLI App_ you need to have Python3.
